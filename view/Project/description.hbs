						<div class="title-line" id="overview">Overview</div>
						<p>Diabetes is a chronic disease found in many people. This disease can cause problems for families, society, and especially the patients that suffer from its various side effects and complications, unless proper medical treatment is received. To be treated properly, glucose monitoring is very important because regularly measured blood glucose levels over a long period can serve as a basis for diagnosis and management of diabetes. Also, for diagnosis and prevention of diabetes in a healthy person, the need for regular measurements of glucose levels over time is suggested. Recently, the self-monitoring of blood glucose in patients with DM is now widely established and supported by a variety of test strips and meters. Nowadays, most of the blood glucose measuring devices on the market are invasive types, which are painful and require blood-gathering. </p>
						<p>Our project U-KNOW is a noninvasive type using a colorimetric method that decodes the color response shown on a urine glucose measuring strip. This method can be routinely used in health examinations as an indirect diagnostic index for diabetes. Our design of a biosensor that measures urine glucose level noninvasively and of a new portable urine glucose monitoring system for health care, where the measured glucose level is displayed digitally and would inform user via portable device. The U-KNOW system improves on the existing blood glucose measurement systems by reducing the unpleasant pain users receive and also improves on the limitations of the type using the colorimetric method. The developed urine glucose measurement system, based on synthetic biology and <a href="{{deviceHardware}}">low cost eletronic parts, is a light-weight instrument</a> designed for self-monitoring of urine glucose level. The users are only required to put a few drops in to our disposable column and the measurement would steps in any way. The measured glucose levels can be transferred to the home health care monitoring app from your phone through the bluetooth. The home health care monitoring system uses the transferred glucose data to generate statistical reports and graphs that are designed to create a comprehensive picture of a patient’s recent glucose level history.</p>

						<div class="title-line" id="detect">Detection of Glucose</div>
						<p>In this part, we plane to detect the glucose concentration via bacteria. We designed our biosensor for urine glucose measurements via a plasmid withe a glucose-induced promoter PI(<a href="http://www.idf.org/membership/wp/taiwan">BBa_K861170</a>) and a monomeric RFP(<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_E1010">BBa_E1010</a>). And there are significantly positive correlation between fluorescence intensity and glucose concentration.</p>
						<p>Promoter PI consists of overlapping consensus cAMP-receptor-protein-binding sites(CRP-binding sites) and consensus RNA polymerase binding site[1]. Hence, the steric hindrance between CRP and RNA polymerase will repress downstream genes at a high concentration of CRP[2]. In <i>E.coli</i> strains( e.g.DH5α and Bl21), a high concentration of CRP is presented when the glucose concentration is low, because, with the increasing adenylyl cyclase activity, the cAMP increase[3]. cAMP will bind the CRP which, in its bound form, can specifically bind the consensus CRP-binding site of Pl promoter , leading to repression of downstream genes. In contrast, when the glucose concentration is high, the adenylyl cyclase activity, cAMP, and CRP are decreased in the bound form. Consequently, an increased expression of downstream RFP E1010 can be a reporter gene as well as an indicator of the presence of glucose can be. </p>

						<div class="title-line" id="safety">Safety System</div>
						<p>For bio-safety, we design the circuit that consists of P<sub>BAD</sub>  promoter and lysis gene. P<sub>BAD</sub> is an <i>E.coli</i> promoter that is induced by L-arabinose. In the absence of arabinose, the dimerized repressor protein araCs would  binds to the AraI1 operator site of P<sub>BAD</sub> and the upstream operator site AraO2, blocking transcription of P<sub>BAD</sub>. With the presence of arabinose, AraC(<a href="http://parts.igem.org/Part:BBa_I13458">BBa_I13458</a>) dimers would bind to it and then changes its conformation so that it interacts with the AraI1 and AraI2 operator sites, permitting the downstream transcription[4]. Using P<sub>BAD</sub> as the promoter of lysis allows us to control lysis process. However, under the enviroment of high concentration of glucose, P<sub>BAD</sub> would be inhibited anyway. Thus, the P<sub>BAD</sub> expression system can be controlled with two often-seen substance, glucose and arabinose. Yet, in order to make glucose effective to P<sub>BAD</sub> the concentration need to be higher than 0.01%.</p>

							<div>Arabinose is added under the test paper coated with our <i>E.coli</i></div>
						</div>
						<p>In our device, powder of L-arabinose is added at the bottom of column, which would not permeate the membrane until the urine is added. After adding the urine sample, the L-arabinose would then dissolve and make contact with <i>E.coli</i>, which is coated on the test paper. If the sample contains no glucose at all, then the circuit will be turn on to produce lysis which result in cytolysis (or cell death)[5].</p>
