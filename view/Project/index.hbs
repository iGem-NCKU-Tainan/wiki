						<div style="width:79%;display:inline-block;">
							<p>Diabetes mellitus, also known as diabetes, is a metabolic diseases in which blood sugar levels cannot be regulated properly. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to many complications including heart disease, chronic kidney failure, or even death.</p>
							<p>Diabetes is usually classified into two types: type1 and type2.</p>

						<ul><li>Type1 diabetes- body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin, leading to insulin deficiency. The majority of these diabetes cases were in children.</li>
								<li>Type2 diabetes- which is characterized by insulin resistance, and sometimes may combine with relatively reduced insulin secretion.</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. Overall, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.</p>

						<p>The figure describes which age groups in the population have the highest proportions of diabetes. The dotted line is the distribution of diabetes prevalence by age for the world; the black line is the distribution for the region; and the country distribution is plotted in the red line. Many middle- and low-income countries have more people under the age of 60 with diabetes compared to the world average. Meanwhile, for high-income countries, a growing population over the age of 60 makes up the largest proportion of diabetes prevalence.</p>
						<div class="title-line" id="pre">Pre-diabetes</div>
						<p>Before having diabetes, many people may have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes.This is known as “pre-diabetes”. If the blood sugar level is above the normal range, the risk of developing full-blown diabetes would increase drastically. It's crucial for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible, due to multiple possible complications if left untreated. However, diagnosing pre-diabetes is not yet a prevalent concept in Taiwan nor in other part of the world. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing worldwide and it is projected that more than 470 million people will have pre-diabetes in 2030. </p>
