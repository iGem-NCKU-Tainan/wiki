							<p>1. The number of people with diabetes has risen from <b>108 million</b> in 1980 to <b>422 million</b> in 2014[1]. There were <b>1.78 million cases of diabetes in Taiwan</b> in 2015[2].</p>
							<p>2. The global prevalence of diabetes among adults has risen from <b>4.7%</b> in 1980 to <b>8.5%</b> in 2014.<br/>
									Meanwhile, the prevalence of diabetes among adults in <b>Taiwan is 10%</b>.</p>
							<p>3. <b>3/4</b> of diabetic people are in low and middle income countries.</p>
							<p>4. Diabetes is a major cause of <b>blindness, kidney failure, heart attacks, stroke</b> and <b>lower limb amputation</b>.</p>
							<p>5. In 2012, an estimated <b>1.5 million deaths were directly caused by diabetes</b> and another 2.2 million deaths were attributable to high blood glucose.</p>
							<p>6. Almost half of all deaths attributable to high blood glucose occur before the age of 70 years. </p>

						<div class="title-content">Introduction of Diabetes Mellitus</div>
						<div style="width:79%;display:inline-block;">
							<p>Diabetes mellitus, also known as diabetes, is a metabolic diseases in which blood sugar levels cannot be regulated properly. If left untreated, diabetes can lead to many complications including heart disease, chronic kidney failure, or even death.</p>
							<p>Diabetes is usually classified into two types: type1 and type2.</p>
							<ul><li>Type1 diabetes- body's immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin, leading to insulin deficiency. The majority of these diabetes cases were in children.</li></ul>
						</div>
						<div class="img" style="display:inline-block;width:20%">

						</div>
						<ul><li>Type2 diabetes- which is characterized by insulin resistance, and sometimes may combine with relatively reduced insulin secretion.</li></ul>
						<p>Type 2 diabetes is far more common than type 1. Overall, around 90% of all adults with diabetes have type 2.</p>

						<p>The figure describes which age groups in the population have the highest proportions of diabetes. The dotted line is the distribution of diabetes prevalence by age for the world; the black line is the distribution for the region; and the country distribution is plotted in the red line. Many middle- and low-income countries have more people under the age of 60 with diabetes compared to the world average. Meanwhile, for high-income countries, a growing population over the age of 60 makes up the largest proportion of diabetes prevalence.</p>

						<div class="title-content">Pre-Diabetes</div>
						<p>Before having diabetes, many people may have blood sugar levels above the normal range, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed as having diabetes.This is known as “pre-diabetes”. If the blood sugar level is above the normal range, the risk of developing full-blown diabetes would increase drastically. It's crucial for diabetes to be diagnosed as early as possible, due to multiple possible complications if left untreated. However, diagnosing pre-diabetes is not yet a prevalent concept in Taiwan nor in other part of the world. World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that the prevalence of pre-diabetes is increasing worldwide and it is projected that more than 470 million people will have pre-diabetes in 2030. </p>

						<div class="title-line" id="idea">Our Idea</div>
						<p>Type II diabetes is mainly due to insensitivity of insulin, resulting in malfunctioning blood glucose regulation. During urine formation, glucose would all be filtered into lumen after filtration process. All the glucose particles are supposed to be recollected  after reabsorption process. The glucose reabsorption is a process via SGLT1/2, members of the sodium glucose cotransporter family which are sodium-dependent glucose transport proteins. Among these two cotransporters, SGLT2 is the major cotransporter involved in glucose reabsorption in the kidney, proximately 90% of totally glucose reabsorption. However, SGLT2 can only transport glucose with the maximum blood glucose level of 180 mg/dl. Due to unstable glucose level, once the glucose level rises higher than SGLT2's limit, then extra glucose above 180 mg/dl would not be absorbed and would be spotted in urine afterward[3]. Which means the urine with glucose then formed. Therefore, we consider testing glucose out of urine would be a good way monitoring renal health.</p>
