						<p class="intro">Compared to the whole project, human practice may not be the most important part. As time goes by, synthetic biotechnology gradually attract people’s attention. There are more and more people discuss about this new technology, discuss about its good and bad. However, people don’t understand well about it. Majority of people consider this new technology is dangerous, unpredictable or harmful to health. On the contrary, sometimes synthetic biotechnology is more healthy to human than normal food to human. Thus, we need to propaganda the correct concept to people, let people can accept our inventions and products.</p>
						<p class="intro">To listen to people's opinions, we also do the questionnaire to students, the new generation, to ask if they know about synthetic biotechnology and diabetes. With the help of experts, we know lots of myth about diabetes. This really help us to popularize the correct concepts of diabetes because most people are like us at that time. </p>

						<p class="intro">Besides, we don’t want to be restricted in this little island. We want to promote these concepts globally, but we know that this is very difficult to us, students. Therefore we hold a Asia-pacific conference, invite 20 teams come and work together to exchange ideas to make our projects perfect. As long as the teams around the world do locally and we, all the iGEM teams, can promote synthetic biotechnology globally.</p>

						<h5>Introduction</h5>
						<img src="{{conf1}}" />
						<p>The 4th iGEM Asia-Pacific Conference 2016 Taiwan is going to held grandly at National Cheng Kung University Tainan for the first time starting from 2016/08/08 to 2016/08/14 organised by iGEM NCKU Tainan. In the past few years, only universities from North part of Taiwan attended iGEM Competiton organised by MIT, Boston. This year, NCKU had formed the first team representing South Taiwan as a succes of historical breakthrough. By involving in Synthetic Biology and iGEM Competiton, we believe that we can improve multidisciplinary cooperation. Besides, to connect every schools in Taiwan also branched out tentatively into international platform.</p>
						<p>We estimated more than 5 countries, approximately 20 teams from different schools will be attending this Meet-up Conferece. Proffesional scholars and entrepreneur will be invited too for academic exchange about Biotechnology and Synthetic Biology. The main programs are inclusive of presentations, poster exhibitions, team experience sharing , Round table , Tainan cultural tours etc.. We truly believed that by this Asia-Pacific Academic Exchange Conference, the teams are able to have communications, achieving better results as well as making NCKU a step closer to become one of the most popular universities in Asia Pacific and also impress the world.</p>
