						<h5>Expecting to dedicate more ideas into iGEM</h5>
						<p>2015.09.21, not as any ordinary day, iGEM_NCKU_Tainan had successfully accomplished our first mission together: The second stage of member recruitment. Although our team consists of 14 members from different faculty, such as Medical Department, Faculty of Social Sciences, Faculty of Sciences, Department of Engineering, Design Department etc, but we realised that there’re a lot of students out there with hidden potential that yet to be discovered and join us as our team still out of students from different field of profession.</p>
						<h5>A quite empty hall opps</h5>
						<p>It’s undeniable that every activities comes with setbacks and difficulty, especially when it comes to genetically engineered machines competitions, students with Finance and Economics and Scientific and Technological Law background will definitely hold back. How do we change the mind concepts of these students that it’s the student with Finance or Literature background that the current society need in order to connect the different ideas and thoughts from all over the world? How do we change the perspectives of these students that engineering technology wasn’t that tough and unreachable? Guess that the first challenge for us to breakthrough is: Are people willing to listen?</p>
