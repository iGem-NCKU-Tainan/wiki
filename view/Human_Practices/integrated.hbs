						<p>Our iGEM team composed of interdisciplinary mates paid a visit to Prof. Chen yesterday. It is our pleasure to discuss with such an enthusiastic scholar, who offered us many valuable information and advice such as an useful data analysis program, the topic of the research for our reference, and even the motivation to work hard. Thanks to Prof. Chen’s assistance, we have not only more clear project to conduct our idea but also faith on ourself. All of us will take on challenges and do our best to overcome every difficulty!</p>

						<p>Next, World cafe session at Asia-Pacific Conference. Each table there'll be a member of iGEM NCKU_Tainan leading other participants to share their iGEM experience throughout their iGEM journey, we can all improve to be better and also learn from our failures and mistakes which bring no harm to every teams. With different projects, we may meet new questions in different point of views from other districts, culture and society.</p>
						<p>Light up : share positive stories, experiences, uniqueness, management tips, etc so that other teams can refer to.</p>
						<p>Fucked up : share failures and downfall of own team in order to allow other teams to learn from mistakes, to understand that story has an ending but in life, every ending is a new beginning. If any of the teams have difficulties, they can speak out too so that others can help to think for a solution.</p>

						<p>Host by professors or representatives of entrepreneurs to lead the participants to think out of the box. Most people might get the wrong idea but this program is carried out through sharing not debating. By connecting different point of views and thoughts of the participants, we can create a whole new idea. The most difference between the professors and us is that they have worked for years, they must have more experience about what people want, what customer need.</p>
						<div class="title-line" id="ques">Questionnaire</div>
						<p>Now having the suggestion form other iGEMers and professionals, we also actually do the questionnaire to common people who have no knowledge about these professional field. Different from us most people don’t know much about synthetic biotechnology even basic biology. Thus, the ultimate goal of human practice is to give rise to the awareness of diabetes. In the questionnaire, we ask them some myth about diabetes and preference of using which devices to detect diabetes. Test paper and blood glucose machine are two major methods to detect diabetes, but both have different shortcomings. Then we ask if they will choose our device instead of these two to see is our project successful or not.</p>
